		<h1> Subject of the lab</h1>

		<P>The purpose of this lab was to get the students familiar with uploading
			images to your website that can be found on the internet and not your
			personal desktop. It also served to reinforce other topics that we just
			learned through practice.
		</p>

		<h2> Challenges</h2>

		<p> After many hours of troubleshooting, with others and by myself, I still
			seem to have an issue with uploading images, and getting my CSS to work
			properly.
		</p>

		<h3>Results</h3>

		<p>I got it to work with help from my professor and TA.
