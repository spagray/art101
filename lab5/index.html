		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>I was a bit confused at what to do in the console in task 1 among a
			couple other small things.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I had trouble getting the changes I made to appear on the site.</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>So far my work is looking similar to that of others, students and
			examples shown. Now I just need it to act right.</p>
